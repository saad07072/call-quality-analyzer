The pipeline analyzes sales call quality within free Google Colab. Audio is obtained either from YouTube (yt-dlp with pytube fallback) or by uploading a file, then standardized to 16 kHz mono WAV. Preprocessing normalizes and cleans audio for better transcription and diarization.

Speaker diarization is handled with pyannote.audio to separate two speakers. Transcription is performed using OpenAI Whisper (tiny model) with timestamps. These are merged so each segment is mapped to a speaker.

The analyzer computes:

Talk-time ratio (who spoke more)

Number of questions asked (engagement)

Longest monologue duration (listening balance)

Sentiment (positive/neutral/negative tone)

Actionable insight (simple recommendation)

A heuristic labels the sales rep vs. customer (based on dominance and questions asked). This approach balances accuracy with runtime efficiency, completing in <30s on free Colab.
